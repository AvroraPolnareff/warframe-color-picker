# What is Warframe Color Picker?

Warframe Color Picker is an easy tool designed to help you with managing your in-game fashion. If you’re a fashionframe enthusiast, this tool will be irreplaceable for you!

All models in Warframe tend to have different textures, bump maps, and other stuff that heavily affects the color, sometimes changing it in a drastic way. In order to solve this, you’ll need a slightly brighter, or less saturated version of the color that you want to achieve. Without this tool, it’d be an absolute nightmare to grind your eyes through all the available palettes, since there are over 3000 colors in the game!

Lucky for all of us, we’ve made an app that lets you adjust your entire color scheme on the fly! Once you’ve adjusted a color, it’ll show a list of the closest colors to the one you want to achieve from all in-game palettes.

1. In order to do that, you first need to make a screenshot of your in-game scheme (using **Snip & Sketch** on Windows is pretty much enough), cropping it in the same way as shown in the picture.

2. Once you've made the screenshot, please insert it in this field via CTRL+V. If it doesn't work, please save it on your PC and use **MANUAL UPLOAD** button.

3. BOOM, you're done!! If you did everything right, of course.
