1. In order to do that, you'll first need to make a screenshot of your in-game scheme using any software at your disposal (pro tip: using **Snip & Sketch** on Windows is pretty much enough), cropping it in the same way as shown in the picture. Please do not use your smartphone camera, that's cringe.

2. Once you've made the screenshot, please insert it in the Scheme Import field via CTRL+V. If it doesn't work, please save it on your PC first, and then use **MANUAL UPLOAD** button. Select the cropped screenshot and click the upload button.

3. BOOM, you're done!! If you did everything right, the scheme will appear in the app. It will take the selected horizontal row of color slots in the **MANUAL** menu.
