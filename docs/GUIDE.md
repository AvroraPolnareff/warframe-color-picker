1. First make a screenshot of your in-game scheme using any software at your disposal (pro tip: using **Snip & Sketch** on Windows is pretty much enough), cropping it in the same way as shown in the picture. Please do not use your smartphone camera, that's cringe.

2. Once the screenshot is ready, use **CTRL+V** in the text field. If it doesn't work, please save it on your PC first, then use **MANUAL UPLOAD** button. Select the cropped screenshot and click the upload button.

3. BOOM, you're done!! If you did everything right, the scheme will appear in the app. 
 
Note: if your **TARGET SCHEME** is set to **MANUAL**, the scheme will take the horizontal row.
