1. First make a screenshot of your in-game scheme using any software at your disposal (for example, using **Snip & Sketch** on Windows is pretty much enough), cropping it in the same way as shown in the guide. Please do not use your smartphone camera, that's cringe.

2. Once the screenshot has been made, use **CTRL+V** in the text field in the **IMPORT** window. If it doesn't work, please save it on your computer first, then use **MANUAL UPLOAD** button. Select the cropped screenshot and click the upload button.

3. BOOM, you're done!! If you did everything right, the scheme will appear in the app. 
 
*Note: if your **TARGET SCHEME** is set to **TABLE**, the scheme will appear horizontally.*
